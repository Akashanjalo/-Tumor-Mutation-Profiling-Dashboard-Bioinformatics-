# 🧬 Tumor Mutation Profiling Dashboard (Bioinformatics)

An interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze **gene mutation data** from breast cancer patients (TCGA-BRCA dataset).

## 🔍 Key Features
- Top Mutated Genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PIK3CA)
- Distribution of Mutation Types (Missense, Splice Site, Frameshift)
- Mutation Burden per Patient
- Filterable mutation table by gene, sample, and type

## 📊 Tech Stack
- Power BI
- TSV/TXT real-world mutation data
- Bioinformatics insights

## 🚀 Goal
To provide a quick and informative visual tool for cancer researchers, clinicians, and analysts interested in gene-level mutation insights.


## 📁 Dataset Source
Data curated from public cancer genomics repositories like [CBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org) / [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
